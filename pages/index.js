              The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, colloquially
              &quot;the Met&quot;, is the largest art museum in the Americas. In
              2022 it welcomed 3,208,832 visitors, ranking it eighth in the list
              of most-visited art museums in the world, and the second-most
              visited art museum in the United States. Its permanent collection
              contains over two million works, divided among 17 curatorial
              departments. The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue, along the
              Museum Mile on the eastern edge of Central Park on
              Manhattan&apos;s Upper East Side, is by area one of the
              world&apos;s largest art museums. The first portion of the
              approximately 2-million-square-foot (190,000 m^2) building was
              built in 1880. A much smaller second location, The Cloisters at
              Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive
              collection of art, architecture, and artifacts from medieval
              Europe.

              The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 with its
              mission to bring art and art education to the American people. The
              museum&apos;s permanent collection consists of works of art from
              classical antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings, and sculptures
              from nearly all the European Old Masters, and an extensive
              collection of American and modern art. The Met maintains extensive
              holdings of African, Asian, Oceanian, Byzantine, and Islamic art.

              The museum is home to encyclopedic collections of musical
              instruments, costumes, and accessories, as well as antique weapons
              and armor from around the world. Several notable interiors,
              ranging from 1st-century Rome through modern American design, are
              installed in its galleries.
